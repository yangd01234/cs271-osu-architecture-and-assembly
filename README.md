## Project 1 - Introduction to MASM
Introduction to MASM program.  The program will display the author, program title, and instructions for the user.  The user will be prompted to input two
numbers.  The program will then calculate the sum, difference, product, (integer) quotient and remainder of the numbers.  Once the program has calculated
the numbers, a terminating message will appear.

## Homework 2 - Fibonacci
This program will prompt the user for the number of Fibonacci numbers to be displayed.  Once the user inputs an integer, the program will then proceed
to calculate and display all Fibonacci numbers including the nth term.

## Homework 3 - Composite Numbers
This program will calculate composite numbers.  The program will request the number of composites to be displayed and also for an integer from 1-400.  
The program then verifies and calcualtes all composite numbers up to and including the nth composite.

## Homework 4 - Random Arrays
This program will request the user to input an integer within range 10-200.  The program will then generate an array of random n integers.  The list
will be displayed in the terminal, sorted, then the sorted array will be displayed.  The mean and median values will then be displayed to the user. 

## Homework 5 - Strings, Macros, and I/O
In this assignment, we were required to write our own ReadVal, WriteVal, procedures for unsigned integers.  We then needed to implement macros for
getString and displayString.  The program requests 10 valid integers from the user and stores the numeric values in an array.  The program
will then display the integers, their sum, and their average.  Conversion routines must use lodsb and stosb properly.
